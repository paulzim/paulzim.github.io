    <h1>Community Building</h1> 
    <p>Community building is one of my favorite professional things to do.</p> 
    <p>My first foray into community building was with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120519230618/http:/docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Main_Page">Cisco DocWiki</a> project, where I was the program manager. We built a publicly-facing collaborative content platform from the ground up, using MediaWiki as our base and constructing from there. I learned all about moderation, quality control, legal compliance, and all of the other things that come along with connecting with the outside world.</p> 
    <p>Later, when I was managing Developer Success for the <a href="https://community.cisco.com/t5/devnet-hub/ct-p/4409j-developer-home">Cisco DevNet team</a>, I became owner of the Cisco developer forums. At the time, the forums were mainly used as a support channel. I then switched gears and became the manager for Developer Community Engagement, and my focus on community grew even greater. I built greater engagement in our forums, and also looked to build the greater community, encouraging participation in social media and third-party forums as well as live events like meetups. Most recently, I was helping host the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/baylisa/">BayLISA community meetups</a> in San Jose.</p> 
    <p>I love working with the community! Please feel free to connect with me!</p>
