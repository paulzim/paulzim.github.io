        <h1>Content Creation and Management</h1>
        <h2>Content Creation</h2>
        <p>
            Content has been the foundation of my career. My first role was a technical writer for <a href="https://comtechservices.com/">Comtech Services</a>,
            a technical documentation consulting firm. From there, I joined a startup, Touch Communications, where I continued to build
            my technical writing skills and learned the ups and downs of startup culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            I moved on to Octel Communications, continuing as a writer and then tech docs manager, where I managed a large team of writers,
            editors, and production specialists. Here, I gained experience in online and embedded content.
        </p>
        <p>
            With my move to Cisco, I returned to writing for a few years before transitioning into program management.
        </p>

        <h2>Program Management</h2>
        <p>
            As a program manager, I tracked departmental metrics using the Balanced Scorecard approach to align goals and measure impact.

        <p>
            My largest accomplishment as a PM was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120519230618/http:/docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Main_Page">Cisco DocWiki</a>,
            a publicly-facing wiki for Cisco technical content. I collaborated with the team to establish the system and addressed issues
            like moderation, content quality, and compliance. I authored articles on this initiative and presented at conferences.

        <h2>People Management</h2>
        <p>
            I became a documentation manager again and continued my focus on content. In the realm of developer content, I assisted the
            <a href="https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/latest/index.html">OpenDaylight open source project</a> with the initial version of
            their wiki-based documentation. I also worked extensively with embedded content for SDKs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Developer Content Manager for Ciscoâ€™s DevNet team, I delved deeply into developer content, mastering the Open API
            spec and Git-based publishing toolchains. In other roles, I built a support knowledge base, developed various forms of
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUvYaWuv_UM">video content</a>, and published online content like
            <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/author/paulzimmerman">blogs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a manager, I led the implementation of content management systems, including a Trisoft DITA-based XML CMS and a
            Git-based toolchain for publishing developer docs to the DevNet site.
