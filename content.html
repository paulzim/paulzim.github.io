    <h1>Content</h1> 
    <h2>Technical Writing</h2> 
    <p>Content has been the foundation of my career. My first role was a technical writer for <a href="https://comtechservices.com/">Comtech Services</a>, a technical documentation consulting firm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoAnn_Hackos">Joann Hackos</a>. From there, I joined a startup, Touch Communications, where I continued to build my technical writing skills and learned the ups and downs of startup culture.</p> 
    <p>I moved on to Octel Communications, continuing as a writer and then tech docs manager, where I managed a large team of writers, editors, and production specialists. Here, I got experience in online and embedded content.</p> 
    <p>With my move to Cisco, I went back to writing for a few years. Then, I became a program manager. </p> 
    <h2>Program Management</h2>
    <p>As Project Manager, I tracked departmental metrics using the Balanced Scorecard approach. </p>

    <p>My largest accomplishment as a PM was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120519230618/http:/docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Main_Page">Cisco DocWiki</a>, which was a publicly-facing wiki for Cisco technical content. I worked with the team to stand up the system as well as work out issues like moderation, content quality, and compliance. I helped author some articles on what we did and also gave presentations at conferences.</p>

    <h2>People Management</h2>
    <p>I became a documentation manager again, and continued with focus on content. Moving into the realm of developer content, I helped out the <a href="https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/latest/index.html">OpenDaylight open source project</a> with the initial version of their wiki-based documentation. I continued to work with embedded content, this time with SDKs.</p> 
    <p>When I joined the DevNet team (Cisco developer relations) as Developer Content manager, I really got busy with developer content. I became intimately familiar with the Open API spec and with Git-based publishing toolchains. As I moved around the organization in other content-adjacent roles, I built a support knowledge base, learned about and published different forms of video content (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUvYaWuv_UM">video content</a>), and put out online content like <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/author/paulzimmerman">blogs</a>.</p> 
    <p>As a manager, I led the implementation of content management systems, including a Trisoft DITA-based XML CMS and also helped with a Git-based toolchain that we used for publishing developer docs to the DevNet site.</p>
    <p><strong>Content is king!</strong></p>
