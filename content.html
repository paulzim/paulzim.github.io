    <h1>Content Creation and Management</h1>
    <h2>Content as the Foundation of My Career</h2>
    <p class="section">
        <p>
            Content has been at the core of my career. 
            I began as a technical writer, where I learned how to translate complex concepts into clear, accessible documentation. 
            Working at Comtech Services, I developed foundational writing skills, which I expanded at 
            Touch Communications, gaining firsthand experience in the fast-paced startup world. At Octel Communications, 
            I took on content leadership, managing a team of writers, editors, and production specialists, and developing expertise in 
            online and embedded content.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Cisco, I transitioned from individual contributor to program and people manager, leading initiatives that improved 
            content quality, accessibility, and distribution . Even as I moved into 
             <a href="developer-relations.html">Developer Relations (DevRel)</a>, I remained deeply involved in 
             creating and curating content , whether through <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/author/paulzimmerman">blogs</a>, 
             technical documentation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUvYaWuv_UM">video content</a>, 
             or <a href="https://community.cisco.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/317191">community engagement content</a>. 
             My career has been built on the principle that great content empowers users and drives engagement, 
             and I bring that philosophy to every project I lead.
        </p>
    <h2>Content Program Management: Strategy, Tools, and Execution</h2>
    <p class="section">
    
        While I started with content creation, I have extensive experience in content program management, 
        where I took the next step to align content strategies with business objectives and user needs. 
        
    </p>

    <h3 class="section">Collaborative Content</h3>
    <p class="section">
        One of my most impactful projects was leading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120519230618/http:/docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Main_Page">Cisco DocWiki</a>, 
            a publicly facing wiki designed to enable collaboration between Cisco, customers, and partners. 
            his initiative required me to manage technical implementation, establish moderation processes, ensure content quality, 
            and address compliance concerns. I documented and presented insights from this 
            project at industry conferences, sharing best practices for crowdsourced content and community engagement.

    <p>
        My content management experience extends into open-source collaboration as well. 
        With the <a href="https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/latest/index.html">OpenDaylight open source project</a>, 
        I worked with several collaborators to build the project's wiki-based documentation, 
        structuring content to support a highly technical audience while enabling community contributions. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="section">Metrics</h3>
    <p class="section">
        As a program manager, I implemented the <strong>Balanced Scorecard approach</strong>  to track key metrics and measure the impact of content initiatives.
    </p>
    <iframe class="pdf section" src="files/BP Newsletter - April 2008 Cut.pdf" title="Balanced Scorecard Example"></iframe>

    <h2 class="section">Leading Content Teams</h2>
    <p>
        As a documentation and content manager, I have led teams responsible for product and developer content. At Cisco, I led the implementation of content management systems (CMS), including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trisoft DITA-based XML CMS</strong> – Standardized structured content creation and improved content reuse across teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Git-based publishing toolchains</strong> – Enabled developers to directly contribute to technical documentation and streamlined the publishing workflow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In my role as Senior Manager of Developer Success, I applied my content expertise to building a robust 
        knowledge base within our ZenDesk customer relationship management system (CRM), 
        which helped make support content easily searchable, well-structured, and actionable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides managing content systems, one of the best things about leadership has been mentoring and developing content professionals. 
        I have guided writers, editors, and developer advocates, helping them refine their skills in technical communication and community engagement. 
        My leadership philosophy is centered on empowering teams to create high-impact content while fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>Through all of my experience with hands-on content creation, strategic content management, and leading content teams, my goal has always been to deliver clear, accessible, and scalable content solutions. 
        I believe that great content is more than just documentation. It is a strategic asset that enhances user experience, drives adoption, and builds community. 
        My expertise in content strategy, content operations, and leadership allows me to bridge the gap between 
        technology and users, which has been a guiding drive thorughout my career.
