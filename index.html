            <h2>Content | Community | Creativity</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Paul Zimmerman. I’ve worn many hats throughout my career, from technical writer to program manager
                to senior leader, each step building my expertise in content strategy, community engagement, developer advocacy,
                and program management.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about empowering developers and creating thriving communities around cutting-edge technologies.
                Whether it’s leading international teams, delivering impactful workshops, or implementing scalable systems, I focus
                on innovation, empathy, and collaboration to achieve results.
            </p>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>My Journey</h2>

                <h3>Content is the Foundation</h3>
                <p>
                    My career began as a technical writer, developing clear and engaging documentation for emerging technologies.
                    At companies like Octel Communications and Lucent Technologies, I honed my ability to translate complex ideas into
                    accessible content and began managing teams to scale this work.
                </p>

                <h3>Pioneering New Platforms at Cisco</h3>
                <p>
                    At Cisco, I took on program management roles where I launched groundbreaking projects like Cisco’s first collaborative
                    documentation platform, the DocWiki. These efforts taught me the power of collaboration and community-building,
                    laying the foundation for my later work in developer relations.
                </p>

                <h3>Elevating Developer Success</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2015, I became Senior Manager of Developer Success, leading global teams to provide support for developers using
                    Cisco’s platforms. I implemented new CRM systems, supported the launch of technical certifications, and earned the
                    Pioneer Award for the DevNet Sandbox project.
                </p>

                <h3>Building Vibrant Communities</h3>
                <p>
                    As Senior Manager of Developer Community Engagement, I focused on creating spaces where developers could thrive.
                    From revamping forums and launching new technical hubs to piloting in-person meetups, I fostered connections that
                    continue to drive innovation.
                </p>

                <h3>Leading with Vision in Developer Advocacy</h3>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I led a team of developer advocates to bridge Cisco’s technologies with the broader developer ecosystem.
                    Highlights include organizing Developer Sustainability Week, presenting at industry conferences, and building
                    partnerships with local communities.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why I Do What I Do</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I’ve been driven by a desire to make technology accessible and engaging for everyone. I believe
                    that great content, thoughtful support, and vibrant communities are the keys to helping developers succeed.
                </p>
