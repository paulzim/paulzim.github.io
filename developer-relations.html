    <p>My last decade has been very focused on developer relations. I have led teams in most aspects of DevRel</p>
    <h2>Developer Content</h2>
    <p>After working for years doing product documentation, I made the change to developer docs. At first, I managed a team in the central networking business unit doing internal developer docs, but with the release of the onePK project, my team and I began working for the world of external developers. Along the way, I led the implementation of a couple of different publishing systems, including a DITA-based XML system for our embedded SDKs, and then I participated in the launch of a Git-based toolchain for developer docs. I became very familiar with the OpenAPI spec, and led the creation of content for the Cisco DevNet team. Along the way, I earned the Chairman's Choice award for my work on the onePK project! </p>

    <h2>Developer Success</h2>
    <p>After content, I moved into the world of support, leading the DevNet Developer Success team. My team answered tickets for our partners, customers, and other random developers in the world. I assumed ownership of the Cisco developer community, and we also answered community posts. Not only did we support code and APIs, but we also took on support for Code Exchange, where code samples were submitted and reviewed for posting, our certification courses for the DevNet certifications, and for general DevNet portal issues. I implemented a ZenDesk customer relationship management system, working with InfoSec, branding, the Cisco TAC organization, and others to set up tickeing and knowledge base authoring. During this time, I was part of the team that earned the Pioneer Award for our work on the DevNet sandboxes.  </p>

    <h2>Developer Community</h2>
    <p>With a change in leadership, we closed down the support function and my role became focused on community. Not only did we ramp up activity on the forums, but we also expanded our presence at live and virtual events, as well as across third-party community platforms.  You can see more details on my <a href="community.html">Community page.</a></p>

    <h2>Developer Advocacy</h2>
    <p>My most recent role at Cisco was as senior manager of Developer Advocacy. After many years of being a tactical leader, this role was a bit more strategic. While leveraging all of my experience in content creation, supporting partners and customers, and building community, I also pushed ahead in the outreach to our developer ecosystem. </p>
