        <h1>Developer Relations</h1>
        <p>
            Developer relations (DevRel) is the bridge between technology providers and the developers who use their tools and platforms.
            It combines elements of technical content creation, advocacy, support, and community building to empower developers and
            create thriving ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Developer Content</h2>
        <p>
            I began my journey in DevRel with developer content. Transitioning from product documentation to developer-focused docs,
            I managed teams that created accessible and impactful resources. I led the implementation of advanced publishing systems,
            including a DITA-based XML system and a Git-based toolchain. My work earned the <strong>Chairman's Choice Award</strong>
            for contributions to the onePK project.

        <h2>Developer Success</h2>
        <p>
            Leading the DevNet Developer Success team was an exciting challenge. My team supported partners, customers, and developers
            by answering support tickets and community posts. I implemented a ZenDesk CRM system to streamline ticket management
            and knowledge base authoring. During this time, I was part of the team that earned the <strong>Pioneer Award</strong> for
            our innovative DevNet Sandbox program.

        <h2>Developer Community</h2>
        <p>
            My focus shifted to community engagement, where I ramped up activity on forums, expanded our presence at events, and
            fostered connections across third-party platforms. By creating engaging programs and content, I helped cultivate a vibrant
            developer community. See more details on my <a href="community.html">Community page.</a>

        <h2>Developer Advocacy</h2>
        <p>
            As Senior Manager of Developer Advocacy, I took on a strategic role, leveraging my experience in content, support, and
            community building. I led outreach efforts, organized events, and delivered workshops to strengthen connections with
            developers and drive innovation in the ecosystem.

        <h2>The Importance of Developer Relations</h2>
        <p>
            DevRel is critical for fostering trust and collaboration between companies and developers. By providing great content,
            responsive support, and meaningful community engagement, DevRel enables developers to adopt and innovate with technology.
            Itâ€™s about building relationships, sharing knowledge, and creating an environment where developers can thrive.
