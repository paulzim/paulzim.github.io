    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <p>
        While I enjoy creating things as an individual contributor, I truly found my stride in leadership roles. My first
        experience as a people manager came in my 20s at Octel Communications, where I learned how to support and guide a team
        to success. Later at Cisco, I embraced several different leadership roles, each offering unique challenges and opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter the team I manage, I always lead with <span class="highlight">compassion</span>, a commitment to <span class="highlight">continuous learning</span>,
        and a focus on <span class="highlight">supporting my team</span>. I believe in working alongside
        my team to understand their challenges and celebrate their successes.

    <h2>People Management</h2>
    <p>
        Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of leading diverse teams, ranging from technical writers and engineers to developer advocates
        and community managers. My approach to people management is rooted in empathy, clear communication, and fostering an environment where
        team members can grow and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Cisco, I led international teams, including a Developer Advocacy group that engaged with the global developer ecosystem, a Developer
        Success team focused on providing top-notch support, and a Content Management team that created impactful technical resources. I prioritized
        professional development and built trust within the team by leading from the trenches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Highlights of my people management experience include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mentoring team members to take on leadership roles themselves.</li>
        <li>Building team structures and processes that scale effectively across international locations.</li>
        <li>Encouraging cross-functional collaboration to enhance team impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Program Management</h2>
    <p>
        I also really enjoy running programs. Many of the skills I use as a people manager also apply to successful
        program management. After earning my <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">PMP certification</a>
        (cert number 1225518) in 2008, I’ve continually refined my skills in program strategy, execution, and impact measurement. I have implemented platforms, produced events, and run operations for several programs. 
    </p>
    <h2>Education and Certification</h2>
    <p>
        While I have a great deal of experience in leadership, I back that up with my education and certifcation. I am a proud Otter, getting my MBA from California State University, Monterey Bay. I also got my PMP certification in 2008 and have maintained my standing. I am always looking for way to improve my leadership skills. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Leadership is about more than titles. It’s about inspiring others, creating a vision, and fostering an environment
        where everyone can thrive. I’m excited to continue leading teams, programs, and initiatives that make a positive impact.
