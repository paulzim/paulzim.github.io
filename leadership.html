    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <p>While I enjoy creating things as an individual contributor, I really found my stride in leadership roles. I first became a people manager in my 20s, at Octel Communications. I later became a people manager again at Cisco, and had several different leadership role during my tenure. No matter what kind of team I manage, I have similar goals. I believe in leading from the trenches. I am happy to get my hands dirty along with my team. Compassion, continuous learning, and support for my team are my guiding principles. </p>
    <p>I also really enjoy program management. Running a program involves many of the same skills as running a people organization, and in some respects, can be even more impactful. I got my PMP (cert number 1225518) back in 2008, and have continued to learn about how to run successful programs. </p>
