    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <p>
        While I enjoy creating things as an individual contributor, I truly found my stride in leadership roles. My first
        experience as a people manager came in my 20s at Octel Communications, where I learned how to support and guide a team
        to success. Later at Cisco, I embraced several different leadership roles, each offering unique challenges and opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter the team I manage, I always lead with <span class="highlight">compassion</span>, a commitment to <span class="highlight">continuous learning</span>,
        and a focus on <span class="highlight">supporting my team</span>. I believe in "leading from the trenches"—working alongside
        my team to understand their challenges and celebrate their successes.
    </p>

    <h2>Program Management</h2>
    <p>
        Running programs is another passion of mine. Many of the skills I use as a people manager also apply to successful
        program management. After earning my <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">PMP certification</a>
        (cert number 1225518) in 2008, I’ve continually refined my skills in program strategy, execution, and impact measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my proudest achievements is leading the team that earned Cisco’s <strong>Pioneer Award</strong> in 2017 for
        the innovative DevNet Sandbox. This program empowered developers by providing hands-on access to Cisco’s technology, driving
        engagement and innovation in the developer community.
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership in Action</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond my work at the office, I’ve had the privilege of leading initiatives that make a difference in the community.
        For example, I led a team of Cisco employees in a <a href="https://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> project in 2017,
        where we worked together to build homes and strengthen our bond as colleagues and friends.

    <p>
        Leadership is about more than titles—it’s about inspiring others, creating a vision, and fostering an environment
        where everyone can thrive. I’m excited to continue leading teams, programs, and initiatives that make a positive impact.
