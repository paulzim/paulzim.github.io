    <p>Outside of my professional life, I also enjoy playing music. More than anything, I like playing shows. Over my life, I have played (and continue to play) with many bands! Some bands didn't last too long, but some of my favorite projects are below:</p>
    <h2>Certain Echos</h2>
    <p>I played bass in this Isla Vista, California band during my college days. We played mostly covers but had a few originals, and we played parties like it was going out of style.</p>
    <h2>Mute Angst Envy</h2>
    <p>I played guitar and keys in MAE, and we had a great run. We were on rotation on Live 105 (San Francisco) (https://www.audacy.com/live105) and played some stellar shows, including opening gigs with Xymox and Wolfgang Press.</p>

    <h2>LuxoCrush</h2>
    <p>After the demise of MAE, I rejoined with Keith St Thomas to play with LuxoCrush. We still play shows to this day!</p>

    <h2>Lisa Dewey and the Lotus Life</h2>
    <p>I joined Lisa Dewey in the early 2000s to play with her full band shows. This is another group that I play with currently!</p>

    <h2>Fascinating Creatures of the Deep</h2>
    <p>I played with Fascinating Creatures of the Deep, handling bass for this surf band. We had a great run, with shows up and down the West Coast, Las Vegas, and even Livorno, Italy!</p>
